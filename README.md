Working on transforming avl tree to black and red tree at first.  

RNB tree's rules:  
```1- Root is allways black```  
```2- Red node's sons are allways black```  
```3- Every path from leaf to root must have the same amount of black nodes```  

## Work in Progress


### Insertion

As the AVL tree does, RNB tree inserts its values comparing keys, if key's new node is lower then actuel node then it goes on left.
Else it goes on right.
We don't compare colors or touch colors until we place the new node in our tree.
